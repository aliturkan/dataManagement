# Data Management & API Integration Platform

A full-stack Java/Spring Boot platform for data management and API integration, implementing modern architectural standards. 
This project demonstrates end-to-end backend development skills, enabling secure and efficient data handling and exposure via RESTful APIs.

---

## Purpose

Aimed at building a robust backend foundation, this platform enables:

- **Centralized data storage and management**
- **Scalable API services** for consumption by frontend or external systems
- **Secure user and data workflows**
- **A reliable starting point** for building full-stack applications

---

## Key Features

- **Java + Spring Boot** for scalable and maintainable backend
- **Spring Data JPA** for database interaction (e.g., PostgreSQL or H2)
- **RESTful API Endpoints** for full CRUD operations on core entities
- **Optional Authentication Layer** (Spring Security + JWT)
- **Maven** for build automation and dependency management
- **GitHub Ready**: CI/CD friendly with a modular, version-controlled codebase
